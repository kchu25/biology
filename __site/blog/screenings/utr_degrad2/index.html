<p><strong>Paper:</strong> Massively parallel reporter assay of 3′UTR sequences identifies in vivo rules for mRNA degradation</p>
<p><strong>Reference:</strong> Rabani et al., <em>Molecular Cell</em> &#40;2017&#41;, PMC5994907</p>
<hr />
<p>So you&#39;ve got two supplementary files - one labeled A&#43;, one labeled A-. Here&#39;s what they represent:</p>
<h2 id="the_quick_answer"><a href="#the_quick_answer" class="header-anchor">The Quick Answer</a></h2>
<p><strong>A&#43; &#61; mRNA reporters WITH poly&#40;A&#41; tails</strong> &#40;36 nucleotides long&#41;</p>
<p><strong>A- &#61; mRNA reporters WITHOUT poly&#40;A&#41; tails</strong></p>
<h2 id="why_two_versions"><a href="#why_two_versions" class="header-anchor">Why Two Versions?</a></h2>
<p>The researchers wanted to understand how poly&#40;A&#41; tails affect mRNA stability. Think of the poly&#40;A&#41; tail as a protective cap on the end of mRNA - it matters for how long the mRNA sticks around in the cell.</p>
<p>They took the same library of ~90,000 different 3′UTR sequences and made two versions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One with poly&#40;A&#41; tails attached &#40;A&#43;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>One without them &#40;A-&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then they injected both into zebrafish embryos and tracked how quickly each version degraded over time.</p>
<h2 id="what_they_found"><a href="#what_they_found" class="header-anchor">What They Found</a></h2>
<p><strong>A&#43; mRNAs lasted longer</strong> - about 3.8 hours on average vs 2.4 hours for A- mRNAs.</p>
<p>But here&#39;s the interesting part: different 3′UTR sequences responded differently to having a poly&#40;A&#41; tail. Some needed it for stability, others didn&#39;t care much. This helped them classify 3′UTRs into three groups based on how they interact with poly&#40;A&#41; tails.</p>
<h2 id="so_are_they_replicates"><a href="#so_are_they_replicates" class="header-anchor">So Are They Replicates?</a></h2>
<p><strong>No</strong> - A&#43; and A- are two different experimental conditions being compared, not replicates of the same thing.</p>
<p>However, <em>within</em> each file, there are some replicate measurements at various timepoints &#40;5 replicates for A&#43;, 2 for A-&#41;.</p>
<h2 id="about_the_data_values"><a href="#about_the_data_values" class="header-anchor">About the Data Values</a></h2>
<p>You might notice the values in the supplementary files aren&#39;t integers - they look like: 2.519, -1.8448, -0.43334, etc.</p>
<p>These are <strong>normalized, log2-transformed UMI counts</strong>, not raw counts. Here&#39;s the process:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Raw UMI counts</strong> - They counted unique molecular identifiers for each reporter</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spike-in normalization</strong> - They added 5 control mRNAs at known amounts &#40;50fg down to 3.125fg in 2-fold steps&#41; to each sample</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Calibration</strong> - They fitted a regression model to the spike-ins to convert UMI counts to &quot;expected mRNA molecules&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Log transformation</strong> - Values are on a log2 scale &#40;which is why some are negative - these represent mRNAs with abundance &lt;1 on the original scale&#41;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the methods: <em>&quot;UMI counts were adjusted to represent the expected number of mRNA molecules in the sample... We fitted a generalized binomial linear regression model to counts of five control mRNAs that were added to samples at known quantities... and normalized by internal mRNA spike-ins.&quot;</em></p>
