## Key Domain Types:

- **RRM (RNA Recognition Motif)**: ~90 amino acids, contains conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs, β-sheet structure
- **PUM repeats**: ~36 amino acids each, 8 repeats form the PUM-HD in a crescent shape
- **CSD (Cold Shock Domain)**: ~70 amino acids, five-stranded β-barrel structure
- **KH domain**: ~70 amino acids, binds single-stranded RNA
- **Zinc fingers**: Metal-binding domains for RNA recognition
- **RS domain**: Serine/arginine-rich region for splicing regulation

## Notes:

1. **Unique proteins identified**: 35 unique protein names from your list of 55 entries
2. **Drosophila-specific proteins**: Many proteins (Hrb98DE, Hrb87F, Hrb27C, pum, msi, elav, etc.) are from *Drosophila melanogaster*
3. **Domain counts**: Reflect RNA-binding domains only; many proteins have additional regulatory or localization domains
4. **CG proteins**: Several Drosophila gene entries (CG14718, CG2950, etc.) lack comprehensive characterization
5. **Data sources**: Information compiled from UniProt, FlyBase, and published literature

For comprehensive and up-to-date domain information, consider querying:
- **FlyBase** (flybase.org) for Drosophila proteins
- **UniProt** (uniprot.org) for detailed annotations
- **Pfam** (pfam.xfam.org) for domain architecture
